# Discord RPC Java

This is the Java implementation of the Discord RPC C++ SDK that can be found in [Discord RPC repository](https://github.com/discordapp/discord-rpc)

## Usage

Include this library with Maven with the following:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.psnrigner</groupId>
    <artifactId>discord-rpc-java</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.3</version>
</dependency>
```

Or for Gradle:
```
compile "com.github.psnrigner:discord-rpc-java:1.0.3"
```

Look in examples package for samples.

## Notes

This project is using Java 8. It can be easily converted to older languages, but staying on an updated version of Java is still better.

If i receive too many requests, i can change it to use Java 7 or lower.

## TODOs

All what needs to be done / fixed is in issues, i would appreciate some help on some of these, especially OSX support.

Feel free to add your name in a CONTRIBUTORS.md file.
